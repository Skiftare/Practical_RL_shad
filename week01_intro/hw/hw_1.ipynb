    "  * Try re-using samples from 3-5 last iterations when computing threshold and training. (2 pts)\n",

    "* Sessions for MountainCar may last for 10k+ ticks. Make sure ```t_max``` param is at least 10k.\n",
    " * Also it may be a good idea to cut rewards via \">\" and not \">=\". If 90% of your sessions get reward of -10k and 10% are better, than if you use percentile 20% as threshold, R >= threshold __fails to cut off bad sessions__ while R > threshold works alright.\n",
    "* _issue with gym_: Some versions of gym limit game time by 200 ticks. This will prevent cem training in most cases. Make sure your agent is able to play for the specified __t_max__, and if it isn't, try `env = gym.make(\"MountainCar-v0\").env` or otherwise get rid of TimeLimit wrapper.\n",
    "* If you use old _swig_ lib for LunarLander-v2, you may get an error. See this [issue](https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/100) for solution.\n",
    "* If it doesn't train, it's a good idea to plot reward distribution and record sessions: they may give you some clue. If they don't, call course staff :)\n",
    "* 20-neuron network is probably not enough, feel free to experiment.\n",
